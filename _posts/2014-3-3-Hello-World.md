I am a full stack science communicator living in Davis, California. I thrive on the challenge of taking a seemingly dull scientific topic or a raw dataset and teasing out the story that lies within. I have a PhD in Integrative Biology from the University of Texas at Austin, one of the top-ranked graduate programs in the country. I have worked in the field of biology for over 8 years, researching topics ranging from the neurobiological underpinnings of social behaviors to the evolution of diverse color patterns. I have varied and extensive experience in science communication, including research, data analysis, grant writing, academic writing, exhibit design, and writing for magazines and blogs.
