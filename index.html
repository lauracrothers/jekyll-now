<p>I'm an experienced scientific communications specialist working on issues at the intersection of food, the environment, and society. I specialize in scientific communication and evaluation services, including:<br>
<ul>
  <li>grant proposal coordination and writing</li>
  <li>writing & editing of scientific manuscripts and reports</li>
  <li>data analysis, visualization, and informational graphics</li>
  <li>content development of educational materials</li>
  <li>science writing for magazines & blogs</li>
    </ul>

When I'm not busy cramming my brain with new information, I'll be found hiking the coasts and mountains of Northern California, trying not to get too bruised and bloodied while I teach myself mountain biking, and fiddling with new recipes in the kitchen.</p>
