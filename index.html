I'm an experienced scientific communications specialist working on issues at the intersection of food, the environment, and society. I specialize in scientific communication and evaluation services, including:</p>

<p>• grant proposal coordination and writing<br>
• writing & editing of scientific manuscripts and reports</p>
<p>• data analysis and visualization</p>
<p>• content development of educational materials</p>
<p>• science writing for magazines & blogs</p>
<p>• informational graphics<br></p>

<p>When I'm not busy cramming my brain with new information, I'll be found hiking the coasts and mountains of Northern California, trying not to get too bruised and bloodied while I teach myself mountain biking, and fiddling with new recipes in the kitchen.</p>
