    I'm an experienced scientific communications specialist working on issues at the intersection of food, the environment, and society. I specialize in scientific communication and evaluation services, including:<br><br>

• grant proposal coordination and writing<br>
• writing & editing of scientific manuscripts and reports<br>
• data analysis and visualization<br>
• content development of educational materials<br>
• science writing for magazines & blogs<br>
• informational graphics<br><br>

When I'm not busy cramming my brain with new information, I'll be found hiking the coasts and mountains of Northern California, trying not to get too bruised and bloodied while I teach myself mountain biking, and fiddling with new recipes in the kitchen.</p>
